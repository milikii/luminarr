# Next step (v15)

Prerequisite completed:
- `search_media` + index-based select works
- `add_to_downloader` works for Transmission
- `get_download_status` works
- `import_to_library` hardlink flow works
- `import done -> refresh_media_server (Emby only)` is landed
- candidate mapping persistence is landed (SQLite)
- minimal import -> refresh `job_event` persistence is landed
- explicit import approval interaction is landed:
  - `import <id/hash>` enters pending and does not execute side effect
  - `confirm <id/hash>` executes import + refresh
  - duplicate/stale confirm is deterministically rejected
- minimal lease/version replay guard for import confirm is landed
- durable `telegram_updates` truth source is landed for Telegram message de-dup
- minimal `jobs.version + lease_owner + lease_until` truth source is landed for import wake/replay + downloader approval wake/replay ownership
- `confirm <id/hash>` now rebuilds execution context from persisted job + approval truth
- parser-level frustration/reset short-circuit is landed for selection reset + pending downloader/import cancel
- explicit pre-dispatch approval for `add_to_downloader` is now landed:
  - numeric select enters pending approval before Transmission side effects
  - `confirm <id/hash>` deterministically routes to downloader or import approval wake
  - downloader duplicate/stale confirm is deterministically rejected
  - pending downloader approval survives restart via persisted `job + approval_record` truth
- smallest persisted manual watchlist baseline is now landed:
  - `watchlist_item` SQLite persistence
  - deterministic `watchlist` / `想看` add/list/remove/clear command path
  - no auto-download side effects
- smallest approval expiry / timeout policy baseline is now landed:
  - pending downloader/import approval persists timeout truth (`approval_record.expires_at`)
  - `confirm <id/hash>` deterministically rejects expired pending approvals
  - expired pending approvals converge to cancelled truth (`approval_record + jobs`)
- smallest reactive recovery baseline for LLM physical failures is now landed:
  - deterministic physical failure detection (`413`, truncated-style errors)
  - same-turn one-time compact-and-retry
  - final user-safe fallback text instead of surfacing raw physical backend error
  - manual fallback verification is passed (`retry_count=2`, safe fallback text)

## Goal

Land the smallest **clarification-stage frustration/reset coverage baseline**.

## Scope

Only do:
- keep current search order, poster-card reply, and candidate mapping behavior unchanged
- keep current Telegram command words for `search/select/status/import/confirm/watchlist` unchanged
- keep the landed downloader/import approval flows, `telegram_updates` de-dup, `jobs` ownership, confirm wake rebuild, reset/cancel behavior, and manual watchlist behavior unchanged
- keep the landed physical-failure reactive recovery behavior stable
- add clarification-stage parser-level frustration detection and deterministic reset/cancel routing
- add focused tests for clarification-stage coverage and no-regression

## Explicit constraints

- do not add new downloader/media server support
- do not add large directory refactor
- do not introduce PostgreSQL / Redis / MQ
- do not add library filename normalization/renaming
- do not introduce Telegram inline keyboard as a requirement for this step
- do not remove existing `import <id/hash>` / `confirm <id/hash>` / `watchlist ...` command paths
- do not change current downloader/import success/failure text bodies
- do not regress the landed execution-hygiene baseline
- do not broaden into generic multi-agent platform work

## Suggested implementation shape

1. detect clarification-stage frustration phrase deterministically at parser level
2. when clarification-stage frustration phrase is detected, short-circuit to deterministic reset/cancel path
3. keep downloader/import success paths and text bodies stable
4. keep current physical-failure reactive recovery behavior unchanged
5. add focused tests and manual verification steps

## Done when

- existing downloader/import approval flows do not regress
- existing Telegram command behavior does not regress
- current search/select/add/status/import/confirm/watchlist/refresh chain remains stable
- clarification-stage frustration phrases no longer trigger extra LLM turns and route deterministically

## After this step

Re-evaluate the smallest next control-layer gap:
- concurrency-safe execution policy for read-only tools
