# Next step (v16)

Prerequisite completed:
- `search_media` + index-based select works
- `add_to_downloader` works for Transmission
- `get_download_status` works
- `import_to_library` hardlink flow works
- `import done -> refresh_media_server (Emby only)` is landed
- candidate mapping persistence is landed (SQLite)
- minimal import -> refresh `job_event` persistence is landed
- explicit import approval interaction is landed:
  - `import <id/hash>` enters pending and does not execute side effect
  - `confirm <id/hash>` executes import + refresh
  - duplicate/stale confirm is deterministically rejected
- minimal lease/version replay guard for import confirm is landed
- durable `telegram_updates` truth source is landed for Telegram message de-dup
- minimal `jobs.version + lease_owner + lease_until` truth source is landed for import wake/replay + downloader approval wake/replay ownership
- `confirm <id/hash>` now rebuilds execution context from persisted job + approval truth
- parser-level frustration/reset short-circuit is landed for selection reset + pending downloader/import cancel
- explicit pre-dispatch approval for `add_to_downloader` is now landed:
  - numeric select enters pending approval before Transmission side effects
  - `confirm <id/hash>` deterministically routes to downloader or import approval wake
  - downloader duplicate/stale confirm is deterministically rejected
  - pending downloader approval survives restart via persisted `job + approval_record` truth
- smallest persisted manual watchlist baseline is now landed:
  - `watchlist_item` SQLite persistence
  - deterministic `watchlist` / `想看` add/list/remove/clear command path
  - no auto-download side effects
- smallest approval expiry / timeout policy baseline is now landed:
  - pending downloader/import approval persists timeout truth (`approval_record.expires_at`)
  - `confirm <id/hash>` deterministically rejects expired pending approvals
  - expired pending approvals converge to cancelled truth (`approval_record + jobs`)
- smallest reactive recovery baseline for LLM physical failures is now landed:
  - deterministic physical failure detection (`413`, truncated-style errors)
  - same-turn one-time compact-and-retry
  - final user-safe fallback text instead of surfacing raw physical backend error
  - manual fallback verification is passed (`retry_count=2`, safe fallback text)
- smallest clarification-stage frustration/reset coverage baseline is now landed:
  - no-result clarification pending truth is tracked per chat in-process
  - frustration phrases (`不对/停/重来/换一个/算了/取消`) deterministically short-circuit clarification reset
  - existing pending downloader/import cancel routing remains stable

## Goal

Land the smallest **read-only concurrency-safe execution policy baseline**.

## Scope

Only do:
- keep current search order, poster-card reply, and candidate mapping behavior unchanged
- keep current Telegram command words for `search/select/status/import/confirm/watchlist` unchanged
- keep the landed downloader/import approval flows, `telegram_updates` de-dup, `jobs` ownership, confirm wake rebuild, reset/cancel behavior, and manual watchlist behavior unchanged
- keep the landed clarification-stage frustration/reset behavior unchanged
- keep the landed physical-failure reactive recovery behavior stable
- add the smallest execution policy that marks read-only paths concurrency-safe
- ensure side-effect paths remain serialized and unchanged
- add focused tests for concurrency-safe markers/routing and no-regression

## Explicit constraints

- do not add new downloader/media server support
- do not add large directory refactor
- do not introduce PostgreSQL / Redis / MQ
- do not add library filename normalization/renaming
- do not introduce Telegram inline keyboard as a requirement for this step
- do not remove existing `import <id/hash>` / `confirm <id/hash>` / `watchlist ...` command paths
- do not change current downloader/import success/failure text bodies
- do not regress the landed execution-hygiene baseline
- do not add global scheduler or multi-process orchestration in this step
- do not broaden into generic multi-agent platform work

## Suggested implementation shape

1. identify current read-only tool paths and side-effect tool paths explicitly
2. add the smallest concurrency-safe declaration/guard only for read-only paths
3. keep side-effect serialization path and lease/approval protocol unchanged
4. keep current physical-failure and frustration/reset behavior unchanged
5. add focused tests and manual verification steps

## Done when

- existing downloader/import approval flows do not regress
- existing Telegram command behavior does not regress
- current search/select/add/status/import/confirm/watchlist/refresh chain remains stable
- read-only paths have explicit concurrency-safe policy without changing side-effect behavior

## After this step

Re-evaluate the smallest next control-layer gap:
- isolated explore-agent / explore-subflow for ambiguous title resolution
